        <h2>About River Ecology</h2>
        <p>
            River ecology is the study of the interactions between organisms and their environment in river ecosystems. It encompasses the examination of water quality, the diversity of aquatic life, and the impact of human activities on rivers.
        </p>

        <h2>Ecological Importance</h2>
        <p>
            Rivers play a vital role in our ecosystems. They provide habitats for various species, serve as a source of freshwater, and contribute to nutrient cycling. Understanding river ecology is essential for the conservation of these valuable ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p># The Ganga River is among the largest rivers in Asia, flowing for roughly over 2,500 km, from Goumukh in Uttarakhand to the Bay of Bengal at Ganga Sagar in West Bengal, covering 26% of India’s landmass. It is a trans-boundary river forming the world’s largest delta, Sunderbans, spread across India and Bangladesh. As the remnants of the eastern edge of the Tethys Sea, the Ganga Basin is home to a wide variety of relic, rare and threatened species. These include the Gangetic dolphin (Platanista gangetica), three species of otters viz. the Smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata), Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and the Small clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus), the Critically Endangered Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), Mugger or Indian marsh crocodile (Crocodylus palustris), Estuarine crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) and at least 12 species of freshwater turtles, including the Critically Endangered Batagur kachuga. Within the Ganga River system, 143 different freshwater fish species, belonging to 11 orders, 32 families and 72 genera have been reported including the Critically Endangered Ganges shark (Glyphis gangeticus), Gangetic stingray (Himantura fluviatilis), Golden mahseer (Tor putitora) and Hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha).
        </p>
        <p># Spread across 11 states, the Ganga Basin covers an area of roughly 1 million km2. The Basin is among the most densely populated river basins in the world, supporting more than 100 Class I and II cities and towns, and thousands of villages. The ever-increasing demand for development has resulted in water scarcity and water quality degradation throughout the basin. Nearly all of the sewage, rarely treated, from these settlements enters the basin’s waterways. In addition to these domestic and industrial pollutants, hundreds of human corpses and thousands of animal carcasses are released in to the river each day as spiritual rites. Population pressures, paucity of investment in water quality infrastructure and a lack of empowerment of the people continue to contribute to the deteriorating state of the Ganga.</p>
